## DSIR Instructor Code Challenge

### Welcome! 

> Please review the dataset and answer the questions provided.

# DEADLINE: 5:00 p.m. EST on Sunday, August 27, 2017.

### Instructions! 

1. Please create a Jupyter notebook and save your code in a github gist. 
2. In your notebook, create two markdown headings: `#Part 1` & `#Part 2`. 
3. For each part, complete the following challenges. 

> Note: Please take *no more than 8 hours* to complete both of these challenges.

## Part 1: Modeling

### Background
In this challenge, we are looking to assess your Python coding ability and data science skills. We'll be working on [the following dataset, which includes is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution](bank-full.csv). The task is to predict for each client, whether or not they will subscribe a term deposit. Please follow the guidelines below.

---

#### Python Coding and Data Set
- Load in the data file.
- Comment on any steps you might take to evaluate or transform the dataset.
- Compute the mean and median age among individuals who do subscribe a term deposit and among individuals who do not subscribe a term deposit. Do the mean and median differ among those who subscribe a term deposit? What about among those who do not subscribe a term deposit? Explain how you would identify this.
- Write a function to generate bootstrap samples of the data. Your function should default to taking a bootstrapped sample of size 100.

#### Exploratory Analysis
- Identify 2-3 variables that are predictive of whether or not the client will subscribe a term deposit.
- Display the relationship visually and write 1-2 sentences explaining the relationship.

#### Modeling
- Build a model to predict whether or not the client has subscribed a term deposit.
- Use at least two classification techniques; compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of each.
- Identify how you would control for overfitting in each classification technique.
- Evaluate the performance of each model. Be robust in your analysis.
- In each model, identify the most important predictive variables and explain how you identified them.

#### Explanation
- To Technical Audiences
    - Explain the limitations of your analysis and identify possible further steps you could take.
- To Non-Technical Audiences
    - Write a short summary of your analysis, explaining how your model works and how it performs.
    - Briefly explain the factors that contributed to identifying subscription versus non-subscription.

## Part 2

### Background
During your role in our data science immersive, you'll need to be able to quickly scan and debug student code, while providing helpful feedback or tips. Therefore, this challenge is intended to help you demonstrate your instructional skills!

### Instructions
In the same notebook from Part 1, create a section for Part 2. Move onto Part 2 and log your responses accordingly. Please provide feedback for both of the sample student submissions provided below. Use the following guidelines to help structure your responses:

1. **Code**
    - Feel free to comment on style, library usage, or other improvements.
2. **Methodology**
    - Feel free to comment on the student's data setup, modeling methodology, and model evaluation.
3. **Conceptual Understanding**
    - Finally, feel free to add any suggestions or takeaways on how the student could continue to improve their understanding of these concepts.

> Note: Assume the student is a relative beginner with novice programming skills. Their background may include college courses in data or statistics, but don't assume that they are comfortable with these concepts.

### Sample Student Submissions

- [Student Samples: Please review the following *two* python code snippets taken from student submissions.](https://gist.github.com/jeff-boykin/3af5e25eabd6c10d8aa248c556f625a0)

---

## Submission

Include your work for Part 1 and Part 2 in the same Jupyter notebook. When you're finished, please submit a link to your Jupyter notebook using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to render your gist. Afterward, we will review your submission and follow up with you. Good luck!!
